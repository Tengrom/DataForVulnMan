# Among items analisys 

## Intro: 
Item analysis refers to the process of statistically analyzing assessment data to evaluate the quality and performance of your test items. Chart used in  notebook. It  include all Data science steps and below data presentations:

* Treemap -  Visualization composed of nested rectangles. Main Rectangles are software with contain smaller  rectangles with are CVE for those software. Size of rectangle are number of host with have those CVE and color is responsible for criticality level of CVE
