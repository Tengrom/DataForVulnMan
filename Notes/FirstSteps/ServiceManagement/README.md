# Risk management - List of first steps
* Divide vulnerabilities for 3 categories

* Lack   of  patching :  Easy to resolve by deploying patches

* Configuration / Hardening:  Medium level  to resolve hardening  standards

* Cryptography :  Require cryptography policy and information what type of data is on hosts

* Prepare lists of security control  with could help  mitigate detected vulnerabilities 

* Start resolving vulnerabilities from first  category with high and critical vulnerabilities and calculate reduction of priority using CVSS calculator https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N
